Angularjs Dominion Randomizer
All design and code (except external libs) copyright Urchin Colley 2015

This is a web application that randomizes sets of supply cards for the Dominion
card game (check out http://dominionstrategy.com/ for more about the game). To use
this randomizer, you will have to clone this repo and serve it.

One possible way:
- clone this repository
- cd into it
- run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
- go to localhost:8000/views in a web browser

The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of Angularjs.  The front-end is
bare-bones and there are a few small bugs in this app, but it's been a good project
to learn with and the end product is useful if you love to play Dominion and own
lots of expansions for it (as does the author of this project).
